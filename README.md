# Portfolio in React with Three.JS and Framer Motion
### ðŸš¨ Warning ðŸš¨ ###
I didn't design this portfolio model. The purpose of this repository was for me to learn how to use the Three.JS and Framer Motion tools. I was also able to learn how to use Tailwind CSS. I followed the JavaScript Mastery tutorial on Youtube. Afterwards, I modified the site to my image and turned it into my portfolio.
